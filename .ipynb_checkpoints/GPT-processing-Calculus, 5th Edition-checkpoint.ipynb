This contradicts the definition of $i_{r}$. Similarly, suppose $a_{r}>a_{s}$.

For any vertex $v$ of $G$, the trail $T$ enters and leaves $v$ the same number of times without repeating any edge. Hence $v$ has even degree.\\n\\nSuppose conversely that each vertex of $G$ has even degree. We construct an Eulerian trail. We begin a trail $T_{1}$ at any edge $e$. We extend $T_{1}$ by adding one edge after the other. If $T_{1}$ is not closed at any step, say, $T_{1}$ begins at $u$ but ends at $v \\\\neq u$, then only an odd number of the edges incident on $v$ appear in $T_{1}$; hence we can extend $T_{1}$ by another edge incident on $v$. Thus we can continue to extend $T_{1}$ until $T_{1}$ returns to its initial vertex $u$, i.e., until $T_{1}$ is closed. If $T_{1}$ includes all the edges of $G$, then $T_{1}$ is our Eulerian trail.\\n\\nSuppose $T_{1}$ does not include all edges of $G$. Consider the graph $H$ obtained by deleting all edges of $T_{1}$ from $G$. $H$ may not be connected, but each vertex of $H$ has even degree since $T_{1}$ contains an even number of the edges incident on any vertex. Since $G$ is connected, there is an edge $e^{\\\\prime}$ of $H$ which has an endpoint $u^{\\\\prime}$ in $T_{1}$. We construct a trail $T_{2}$ in $H$ beginning at $u^{\\\\prime}$ and using $e^{\\\\prime}$. Since all vertices in $H$ have even degree, we can continue to extend $T_{2}$ in $H$ until $T_{2}$ returns to $u^{\\\\prime}$ as pictured in Fig. 8-41. We can clearly put $T_{1}$ and $T_{2}$ together to form a larger closed trail in $G$. We continue this process until all the edges of $G$ are used.

The path $P$ together with the edges $\\\\left\\\\{v, v_{1}\\\\right\\\\}$ and $\\\\left\\\\{v, v_{3}\\\\right\\\\}$ form\\\\\\\\\\na cycle $C$ which encloses either $v_{2}$ or $v_{4}$. Consider now the subgraph $K$ generated by the vertices painted $c_{3}$ or $c_{4}$. Since $C$ encloses $v_{2}$ or $v_{4}$, but not both, the vertices $v_{2}$ and $v_{4}$ belong to different components of $K$. Thus we can interchange the colors $c_{2}$ and $c_{4}$ in the component containing $v_{2}$ without destroying the coloring of $G-v$. Then $v_{2}$ and $v_{4}$ are painted by $c_{4}$, and we can choose $c_{2}$ to paint $v$ and obtain a 5-coloring of $G$. Thus $G$ is 5 -colorable and the theorem is proved.\\n',\n",

For any vertex $v$ of $G$, the trail $T$ enters and leaves $v$ the same number of times without repeating any edge. Hence $v$ has even degree.\\n\\nSuppose conversely that each vertex of $G$ has even degree. We construct an Eulerian trail. We begin a trail $T_{1}$ at any edge $e$. We extend $T_{1}$ by adding one edge after the other. If $T_{1}$ is not closed at any step, say, $T_{1}$ begins at $u$ but ends at $v \\\\neq u$, then only an odd number of the edges incident on $v$ appear in $T_{1}$; hence we can extend $T_{1}$ by another edge incident on $v$. Thus we can continue to extend $T_{1}$ until $T_{1}$ returns to its initial vertex $u$, i.e., until $T_{1}$ is closed. If $T_{1}$ includes all the edges of $G$, then $T_{1}$ is our Eulerian trail.\\n\\nSuppose $T_{1}$ does not include all edges of $G$. Consider the graph $H$ obtained by deleting all edges of $T_{1}$ from $G$. $H$ may not be connected, but each vertex of $H$ has even degree since $T_{1}$ contains an even number of the edges incident on any vertex. Since $G$ is connected, there is an edge $e^{\\\\prime}$ of $H$ which has an endpoint $u^{\\\\prime}$ in $T_{1}$. We construct a trail $T_{2}$ in $H$ beginning at $u^{\\\\prime}$ and using $e^{\\\\prime}$. Since all vertices in $H$ have even degree, we can continue to extend $T_{2}$ in $H$ until $T_{2}$ returns to $u^{\\\\prime}$ as pictured in Fig. 8-41. We can clearly put $T_{1}$ and $T_{2}$ together to form a larger closed trail in $G$. We continue this process until all the edges of $G$ are used.

Note $e$ is a path from $u$ to $v$. Suppose the resulting graph $G-e$ has a path $P$ from $u$ to $v$. Then $P$ and $e$ are two distinct paths from $u$ to $v$, which contradicts the hypothesis. Thus there is no path between $u$ and $v$ in $G-e$, so $G-e$ is disconnected.\\n\\n(iii) implies (iv) Suppose $G$ contains a cycle $C$ which contains an edge $e=\\\\{u, v\\\\}$. By hypothesis, $G$ is connected but $G^{\\\\prime}=G-e$ is disconnected, with $u$ and $v$ belonging to different components of $G^{\\\\prime}$ (Problem 8.41) This contradicts the fact that $u$ and $v$ are connected by the path $P=C-e$ which lies in $G^{\\\\prime}$.

Suppose $G$ is 2-colorable. Let $M$ be the set of vertices painted the first color, and let $N$ be the set of vertices painted the second color. Then $M$ and $N$ form a bipartite partition of the vertices of $G$ since neither the vertices of $M$ nor the vertices of $N$ can be adjacent to each other since they are of the same color.\\n\\n(ii) implies (iii). Suppose $G$ is bipartite and $M$ and $N$ form a bipartite partition of the vertices of $G$. If a cycle begins at a vertex $u$ of, say, $M$, then it will go to a vertex of $N$, and then to a vertex of $M$, and then to $N$ and so on. Hence when the cycle returns to $u$ it must be of even length. That is, every cycle of $G$ will have even length.\\n\\n(iii) implies (i). Lastly, suppose every cycle of $G$ has even length. We pick a vertex in each connected component and paint it the first color, say red. We then successively paint all the vertices as follows: If a vertex is painted red, then any vertex adjacent to it will be painted the second color, say blue. If a vertex is painted blue, then any vertex adjacent to it will be painted red. Since every cycle has even length, no adjacent vertices will be painted the same color. Hence $G$ is 2-colorable, and the theorem is proved.\\n',\n",

Suppose $p>5$, and the theorem holds for graphs with less than $p$ vertices. By the preceding problem, $G$ has a vertex $v$ such that $\\\\operatorname{deg}(v) \\\\leq 5$. By induction, the subgraph $G-v$ is 5-colorable. Assume one such coloring. If the vertices adjacent to $v$ use less than the five colors, than we simply paint $v$ with one of the remaining colors and obtain a 5-coloring of $G$. We are still left with the case that $v$ is adjacent to five vertices which are painted different colors. Say the vertices, moving counterclockwise about $v$, are $v_{1}, \\\\ldots, v_{5}$ and are painted respectively by the colors $c_{1}, \\\\ldots, c_{5}$.

Note $H$ includes $v_{1}$ and $v_{3}$. If $v_{1}$ and $v_{3}$ belong to different components of $H$, then we can interchange the colors $c_{1}$ and $c_{3}$ in the component containing $v_{1}$ without destroying the coloring of $G-v$. Then $v_{1}$ and $v_{3}$ are painted by $c_{3}, c_{1}$ can be chosen to paint $v$, and we have a 5 -coloring of $G$. On the other hand, suppose $v_{1}$ and $v_{3}$ are in the same component of $H$. Then there is a path $P$ from $v_{1}$ to $v_{3}$ whose vertices are painted either $c_{1}$ or $c_{3}$. The path $P$ together with the edges $\\\\left\\\\{v, v_{1}\\\\right\\\\}$ and $\\\\left\\\\{v, v_{3}\\\\right\\\\}$ form\\\\\\\\\\na cycle $C$ which encloses either $v_{2}$ or $v_{4}$. Consider now the subgraph $K$ generated by the vertices painted $c_{3}$ or $c_{4}$. Since $C$ encloses $v_{2}$ or $v_{4}$, but not both, the vertices $v_{2}$ and $v_{4}$ belong to different components of $K$. Thus we can interchange the colors $c_{2}$ and $c_{4}$ in the component containing $v_{2}$ without destroying the coloring of $G-v$. Then $v_{2}$ and $v_{4}$ are painted by $c_{4}$, and we can choose $c_{2}$ to paint $v$ and obtain a 5-coloring of $G$. Thus $G$ is 5 -colorable and the theorem is proved.\\n',\n",

From the starting point, we can go to any $n-1$ vertices, and from there to any one of $n-2$ vertices, and so on until arriving at the last vertex and then returning to the starting point.

Then $a_{K}[i, j]$, the $i j$-entry in the matrix $A^{K}$, gives the number of paths of length $K$ from $v_{i}$ to $v_{j}$.\\n\\nThe proof is by induction on $K$. A path of length 1 from $v_{i}$ to $v_{j}$ is precisely an edge $\\\\left(v_{i}, v_{j}\\\\right)$. By definition of the adjacency matrix $A, a_{1}[i, j]=a_{i j}$ gives the number of edges from $v_{i}$ to $v_{j}$. Hence the proposition is true for $K=1$.\\n\\nSuppose $K>1$. (Assume $G$ has $m$ nodes.) Since $A^{K}=A^{K-1} A$,\\n\\n$$\\na_{K}[i, j]=\\\\sum_{s=1}^{m} a_{K-1}[i, s] a_{1}[s, j]\\n$$\\n\\nBy induction, $a_{K-1}[i, s]$ gives the number of paths of length $K-1$ from $v_{i}$ to $v_{s}$ and $a_{1}[s, j]$ gives the number of paths of length 1 from $v_{s}$ to $v_{j}$. Thus $a_{K-1}[i, s] a_{1}[s, j]$ gives the number of paths of length $K$ from $v_{i}$ to $v_{j}$ where $v_{s}$ is the next-to-last vertex. Thus all paths of length $K$ from $v_{i}$ to $v_{j}$ can be obtained by summing up the product $a_{K-1}[i, s] a_{1}[s, j]$ for all $s$. Accordingly, $a_{K}[i, j]$ is the number of paths of length $K$ from $v_{i}$ to $v_{j}$. Thus the proposition is proved.\\n\\n',\n",
